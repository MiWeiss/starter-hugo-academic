experience:
  - title: Full time researcher, CNRS
    company: Soft Matter at interfaces group, LPS
    company_url: 'https://www.equipes.lps.u-psud.fr/mmoi/'
    company_logo: org-gc
    location: Orsay, France
    date_start: '2017-01-31'
    date_end: ''
    description: I joined the group *Soft matter at interfaces* in Laboratoire de Physique des Solides in Orsay. At this occasion, I launched new activities related to the role of physical solid surface properties on foam flows. I am also developing new topics related to phase transitions in soft matter.
  - title: Marie Curie fellow
    company: Paris-Diderot University
    company_url: 'http://www.msc.univ-paris-diderot.fr/'

  - title: Marie Curie fellow
    company: Princeton University

    date_end: '2016-06-01'
    description:   I spent nearly 3 years in Howard Stone's group In Princeton. My primarily work was on the drying of colloidal suspensions with a particular focus on the drying stress measurement and the role of solvent absorption by the substrate. I also made experimental studies on the wetting of fibers and the damping of a sloshing motion by foams.
